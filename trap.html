        var nums = [1,2,3];

        // Let's loop over the numbers in our array

            // This is the number we're on...
            var num = nums[i];

            // We're creating a DOM element for the number
            var elem = document.createElement('div');
            elem.textContent = num;

            // ... and when we click, alert the value of `num`
            elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
                alert(this.textContent);
                //This is a trap as num is always 3 when the loop is done
                //alert(num);
            });

            /*The bolded part is the outer function. We immediately invoke it by wrapping it in parentheses and calling it right away, passing in num. This method of wrapping an anonymous function in parentheses and calling it right away is called an IFFE (Immediately-Invoked Function Expression, pronounced like "iffy"). This is where the "magical" part happens.

            We're passing the value of num into our outer function. Inside that outer function, the value is known as numCopy -- aptly named, since it's a copy of num in that instant. Now it doesn't matter that num changes later down the line. We stored the value of num in numCopy inside our outer function.

            Lastly, the outer function returns the inner function to the event listener. Because of the way JavaScript scope works, that inner function has access to numCopy. In the near future, num will increment, but that doesn't matter. The inner function has access to numCopy, which will never change.

            Now, when someone clicks, it'll execute the returned inner function, alerting numCopy.*/

                    alert(numCopy)
                    };
                })(num));
